# Annotation process

 * Evolutionary Urban Theory: core network (degree > 2) of 1252
 * one class only: choice on what seems the main contribution
 * modelling studies with an empirical application (ex CA on a given area) -> model
 * systematic reviews, conceptual papers, epistemology -> theory (includes epistemo of modelling)
 * some languages not included: CN, turk, polonais, FI, RU, Ar, KOR,SW
 * if time later : annotate country/city case study [! tool cybnws]
 * unrelated removed [ex thrust earthquakes]
 * rq: "training and dissemination" -> could be an other domain of knowledge?
 * benchmark-type approaches (ex comparison of stat models) -> method
 * sometimes limit between model and method is fuzzy: "framework"
 * tools are rare: OpenMOLE, Gamma, software libraries
 * [quasi tjs bossé avec distinction empir/model - pertinent?]
 * [qd un modele laisse t-il une trace? utilisé comme brique? ex gravity, puis 4 etapes, etc., ou discrete choices]
 * spatial analysis with indices only, and not really model -> empirical ; method if introduces indices
 * [ma these? main contrib -> model (important if train models on main contrib)][if want to be accurate, need to check if method new, etc?]
 * [simpopnet analysis: intro ni model ni methode -> empirique] -> reproducibility studies -> ?
 * [rq: a multiplier coms, avec titre flou et/ou fumeux -> bruit dans la cartographie! peut etre appris par l'algo?]
 * [rq : SR have a role of their own -> could empirically refine the KD typology with an endogenous one, by function? or interactions?]
